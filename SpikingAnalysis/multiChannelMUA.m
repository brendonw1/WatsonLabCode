function [discrt,contin] = multiChannelMUA(data)

% Gets multi-channel MUA for later alignment to stimuli or
% behavioral/neurophysiological events. Useful for pre-SUA analyses.
%
%
%
% INPUT ___________________________________________________________________
% - data: vector or 2D matrix from bz_LoadBinary, with voltage samples
%   and channels in dimensions 1 and 2 respectively.
%
%
%
% OUTPUTS _________________________________________________________________
% - discrt: column of cells containing timestamp vectors at the original
%   sampling rate (one cell per channel).
%
% - contin: binary version of data (same dimensions of the input), with
%   timestamps marked as "1".
